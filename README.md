# incode_test_app

The incode_test_app created with Flutter using Clean Architecture + BLoC patterns.

My main task during the development of this project was to develop, first of all, a flexible and extensible application architecture. Despite the fact that it is not quite reasonable for a project of this level, I thought it would be a good practice and also an opportunity to demonstrate skills. 

Anyway, thanks for your attention, screenshots are attached below.
